# Biodiversity-Project
This project is part of my data science portfolio and was created to showcase some of the skills I have learned since I started my journey into programming and data science!

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze Bioversity across parks in the United States. Specifically, conservation status across parks and species will be analyzed to determine what factors affect conservation status.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* Dataframe modfications
* Data cleaning and analysis

### Technologies
* Pandas
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

### Project Description
Two .csv files were used in this project, both obtained from Codecademy. They contain data on species and observations of these species throughout parks in the United States.
The main questions that were asked at the beginning were: 
  * What, if any, are the predictors of conservation status in these species?
  * How prevalent is a conservation status within these parks?
More questions and thoughts came up throughout the exploration of the data. These questions were to be answered using visualizations, such as bar graphs, and also with numerical analysis.

### Conclusion
The main questions/goals of the project were reached.
