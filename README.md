# Biodiversity-Project
This project is part of my data science portfolio and was created to showcase some of the skills I have learned since I started my journey into programming and data science!

Please refer to the .ipynb file for the project code.

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze Bioversity across parks in the United States. Specifically, conservation status across parks and species will be analyzed to determine what factors affect conservation status. Most are familiar with the term 'endangered' as a conservation status, but there are also 'species of concern', 'threatened', and 'in recovery'. This project will look into how these conservation statuses are distributed among species and parks. 

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* Dataframe modfications
* Data cleaning and analysis

### Technologies
* Pandas
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

### Project Description
Two .csv files were used in this project, both obtained from Codecademy. They contain data on species and observations of these species throughout four parks in the United States.
The main questions that were asked at the beginning were: 
  * What, if any, are the predictors of conservation status in these species?
  * How prevalent is a conservation status within these parks?
These questions were answered using visualizations, such as bar graphs, and also with numerical analysis. Percentages were used to showcase how conservation status differs between different species groups.
Bar graphs showed a visual comparison of how many conservation statuses are prevalent, and how they relate to species groups.

### Conclusion
The main questions/goals of the project were reached, with the data showing that conservation status is not evenly distributed among species groups. Birds have the most conservation statuses as a total, with vascular plants and mammals having the next two highest counts.
When comparing the percentage of species with conservation status, vs the total population percentage, the data tells a different story. These three species groups also have the highest percentage that have a conservation status, but as it relates to the total population, birds and mammals have a much higher rate of conservation status.

Although the questions were answered, possible improvements or further questions that could be answered in another review:

   * Which kinds of species are most prevalent in each park?
   * How does the conservation status vary between the parks?
   * Is it possible to predict if a species will become endangered, or a species of concern?
